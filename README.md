# Bing daily wallpaper downloader

If you love the daily bing backgrounds as I do this script will help you to customize your desktop.

Recommended usage:

* Copy the python file on your system
* Change the "{***put your preferred directory here****}" code for a suitable path in your system [proposed by @tehAnswer]
* Set file permissions to chmod a+x bing-downloader-py
* Add a chron job to execute that file

Images will be saved at ~/Pictures for the moment, then you just need to change your desktop settings to set this file as a desktop backgorund
