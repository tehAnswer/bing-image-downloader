# Bing Dialy Wallpaper Downloader (B.D.W.D)

If you love the daily bing backgrounds as I do this open source project will help you to customize your desktop without any effort.

## Usage

* Clone this repository anywhere in your machine!
* Change the "{***put your preferred directory here****}" code for a suitable path in your system [proposed by @[tehAnswer](http://github.com/tehAnswer)].
* Set file permissions to chmod a+x bing-downloader-py.
* Set your preferred directory permissions to 777!
* Add a chron job to execute that file.

_**DISCLAIMER**: So far, the images are going to be saved in `~/Pictures`, then you just need to change your desktop settings to set this file as a desktop background._
